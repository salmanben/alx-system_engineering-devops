When you type "https://www.google.com" and hit Enter, your browser begins by requesting the IP address of Google's server from the DNS.
Using TCP/IP, a secure connection (HTTPS/SSL) is established, verified by an SSL handshake.
The request passes through firewalls and load balancers, distributing it across Google's servers for efficient handling. 
A web server processes the request, potentially assisted by an application server, to generate the requested webpage.
This often involves accessing databases for dynamic content.
The assembled page is sent back through the same process and displayed in your browser, completing the cycle in a fraction of a second.
